## Project 1-1: Treadmill Interface

### How to run my code
Run **summer.py**. You must have the arcade library installed either through your virtual environment or in your local machine.

### Motivation
I am a runner, so I often use a treadmill and I wanted to learn how to incorporate timing into my code.

### Description
The user is presented with the interface for a treadmill, the user can start the treadmill and adjust the speed, see their pace, time, and distance run.

### Buttons
- **Start Button**: Starts the treadmill.
- **Up/Down Buttons**: Change the treadmill's speed.

### Python Concepts Utilized
- Using classes to define different buttons and their actions.
- Using string formatting techniques to present the speed, pace, and distance.

### Arcade Features Utilized
- Making clickable text buttons.
- Using `on_update` to count time, and using that to update the timer and the distance.

### Future Steps
- Create **pause** and **stop** buttons.
- Improve the overall look of the interface by boxing off the elements.
- Create and end screen that shows distance, time, and overall pace.
